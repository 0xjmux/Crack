# Crack
My First Python Password Cracker

This is designed to crack SHA1 hashed passwords that don't use a salt. If it needs a salt, this isn't the cracker to use. It was more of a proof of concept than anything else, as python isn't really the best language to build a password cracker in. 

If you find any bugs, be sure to let me know. It needs rockyou.txt, which you can get online. It also comes built in to some linux distributions. 

More cryptography focused projects should be coming soon.
